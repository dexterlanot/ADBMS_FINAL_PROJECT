            The <b> Blood Bank Management System </b> is designed to
            efficiently manage and maintain records of blood donations, blood
            requests, and blood inventory levels. The system is used to track
            the donor and receiver information, blood type, and the stocks
            available. The blood bank management system aims to streamline the
            blood donation process and ensure that a safe and adequate blood
            supply is available to meet the needs of patients.

          <h1>SDG Goal 3: Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages</h1>
          <small><strong> Target 3.8 </strong>
            Achieve universal health coverage, including financial risk
            protection, access to quality essential health-care services and
            access to safe, effective, quality and affordable essential
            medicines and vaccines for all.
          </small>
          <p>A comprehensive blood bank management system can help address the
            challenges that blood banks and hospitals face in ensuring a
            steady supply of safe blood for patients in need. With the help of
            digital platforms and technology-based solutions, the system can
            streamline the blood donation process, track donations, and manage
            inventory effectively. It can also facilitate the distribution of
            blood to hospitals and medical facilities, reducing wastage and
            ensuring that every drop of blood is used effectively to save
            lives.
          </p>
          <p>
            Moreover, a blood bank management system can help in maintaining
            the quality and safety of blood by monitoring the blood's
            temperature during storage and transportation. This can prevent
            spoilage and contamination, reducing the risk of infections in
            patients. By providing a user-friendly digital platform for blood
            donation and distribution, the system can also encourage community
            engagement and foster a culture of voluntary blood donation. This
            can contribute to the larger goal of promoting well-being and
            sustainable development by improving health outcomes and reducing
            the risk of morbidity and mortality. In conclusion, the
            development of an efficient blood bank management system can play
            a vital role in achieving the targets of SDG 3 and promoting
            well-being. By enhancing the availability and accessibility of
            blood donations, the system can help ensure timely access to safe
            blood for patients in need, thereby improving health outcomes and
            reducing the risk of morbidity and mortality.

          <h1>Blood type compatibility: Which blood types are compatible with each other?</h1>
          <p>
            When you are compatible with someone else's blood type, it means that
            your body can accept their blood without any problems. Having a blood
            type that is compatible with blood types other than your own is
            important because it can help to save lives in emergency situations.
            For example, if someone is bleeding and needs a blood transfusion,
            it's important to give them the right blood type so that their body
            can accept it. If they receive the wrong blood type, their body will
            reject it, which can cause serious problems.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are four main blood types: A, B, AB and O. Combinations of
            proteins and sugars, called antigens, on the surface of red blood
            cells are what make the blood type either compatible or incompatible
            with other blood types.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>For example, if you have type A blood, you can only receive type A or type O blood. You cannot receive type B or type AB blood.</li>
            <li>If you have type B blood, you can only receive type B or type O blood. You cannot receive type A or type AB blood.</li>
            <li>If you have type AB blood, you can receive all blood types.</li>
            <li>If you have type O blood, you can only receive type O blood.</li>
